# Welcome to Codebox!

Here is what you need to know.

1. This IDE is open source, you can contribute to it on [GitHub](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox).

2. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P` (or `ctrl-shift-P` on Windows and Linux). This keystroke toggles
   the command palette, which lists every command.

3. We want your feedback! If you have anything positive or negative to say click
   on the `Send Feedback` button at the bottom right of this window.

4. Here is where you can get more help with Codebox
   * The [Codebox docs](http://help.codebox.io/) contain Guides on how to use the IDE.
   * Post issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/issues).

5. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the command palette
   (`cmd-shift-P`) and search for `Welcome`.

6. If you want to read ChangeLog, use the command palette
   (`cmd-shift-P`) and search for `Release Notes`.
